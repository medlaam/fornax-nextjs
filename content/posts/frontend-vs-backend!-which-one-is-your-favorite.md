Front end development is programming which focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that a user will interact with (the client side). Back end development focuses on the side of a website users can't see (the server side).

Front end development is programming which focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that a user will interact with (the client side). Back end development focuses on the side of a website users can’t see (the server side). They work together to create a dynamic website to allow users to make purchases, use contact forms, and any other interactive activities you might participate in while browsing a site. Some examples of dynamic websites are Netflix, PayPal, Facebook, and the Kenzie Academy site you’re currently on.

#### Front and back end developers work in different languages

When you’re coding, you’ll use a programming language. Much like human languages, these languages allow programmers to communicate with their computers through a series of symbols (referred to as code). In simple terms, it’s like giving your computer instructions. Front end developers work in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It’s the standard markup language for creating webpages.
- CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create structure on a site, CSS is used to bring style and flair. It defines a site’s colors, fonts, and the style of other site content.
- JavaScript is a language that can be used to make a site interactive and fun. You can use it to run a game on your site, to name one example.
