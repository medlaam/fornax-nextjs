Beer improves your creativity, while coffee keeps you alert and ready to carry out the ideas you had while drinking. Just be careful not to consume them at the same time—or drink too much of either—or else you'll get nothing done. I Love Coffee created this infographic that looks at the difference between how drinking coffee and drinking beer affect your overall productivity.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

Back end development focuses on the side of a website users can’t see (the server side). They work together to create a dynamic website to allow users to make purchases, use contact forms, and any other interactive activities you might participate in while browsing a site. Some examples of dynamic websites are Netflix, PayPal, Facebook, and the Kenzie Academy site you’re currently on.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n![Frontend](/02.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### Front and back end developers work in different languages\r\n\r\nWhen you’re coding, you’ll use a programming language. Much like human languages, these languages allow programmers to communicate with their computers through a series of symbols (referred to as code). In simple terms, it’s like giving your computer instructions. Front end developers work in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\r\n\r\n- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It’s the standard markup language for creating webpages.\r\n- CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create structure on a site, CSS is used to bring style and flair. It defines a site’s colors, fonts, and the style of other site content.\r\n- JavaScript is a language that can be used to make a site interactive and fun. You can use it to run a game on your site, to name one example.\r\n"},{"slug":"make-the-most-of-your-leaf-with-these-tips","frontmatter":{"title":"Make the most of your LEAF with these tips","author":"Melissa","date":"Sat Jan 1 2022 12:04:21 GMT+0600","tag":["Inspiration","Creative"],"category":["Inspiration","tech"],"images":"/06.jpg"},"content":"\r\nJadedly swankily overcast yikes to put since conscientiously goldfinch avariciously and dear less majestically across far some powerlessly mowed ironically well this since tangibly lobster less floated one some stolid slick hound.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

A primeval warning sign, like hunger or thirst, to seek out a primary resource: connection. Millions of years of evolution have shaped us into creatures who need social bonds in the same way that we need food and water.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we increasingly find ourselves isolated. Loneliness is no longer a powerful enough driver to break us out of the silos created by modern life. Like our insatiable love of high-calorie foods, what was once an adaptive tool has become so misaligned with the way we live that it’s causing, in the words of the former surgeon general Vivek H Murthy, an “epidemic”.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n![Important books](/14.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to compare our collective loneliness against that of previous generations, as we simply haven’t been measuring it consistently, but recent estimates suggest that anywhere from 22% to 75% of American adults are persistently lonely.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of culture-wide structural changes might be to blame: more Americans live alone than ever before; fewer of us are marrying or having children; our average household size is shrinking. In many cases, these changes represent the availability of options where once the only accepted path was marriage and a nuclear family.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they also mean we are spending more time on our own. “Western societies have demoted human gregariousness from a necessity to an incidental,” writes John Cacioppo, a neuroscientist who studied social pain and passed away in March 2018, in his book Loneliness.\r\n"},{"slug":"the-quote-for-this-week!","frontmatter":{"title":"The quote for this week!","author":"Melissa","date":"Wed Dec 17 2022 12:04:21 GMT+0600","tag":["Inspiration","tech"],"category":["Inspiration","tech"],"images":"/05.jpg"},"content":"\r\nTry to make at least one person happy every day.

No question about it, almost everyone who writes a book is a crappy writer.\r\nAnd this is a good thing.\r\nIt’s because the writer spent his life getting GOOD at what he was writing about. He didn’t spend his life being good at writing.\r\nHe didn’t spend his life typing. He ran a country. Or built a robot. Or discovered DNA or walked between the twin towers.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe or She DID something. Something that changed lives. Something that went from his or her head out into the real world.\r\n<br>\r\nBut that’s ok.
